Final Project Proposal- GEOG 575 Henry Stepanus
1. Persona/Scenario
Persona:
Name: Ruth
Description: Ruth is a high school teacher with a passion for geography and environmental
studies. She teaches various subjects including geography, earth science, and
environmental science. Ruth is tech-savvy and often incorporates interactive tools into her
lessons to engage her students.

Key Needs:
Ruth's overarching goal is to provide her students with engaging and informative lessons on
geography and environmental studies. Her primary task is to create lesson plans that
include interactive maps to help students visualize concepts such as ecosystems,
population distribution, and climate change. Key insights for Ruth include the importance
of user-friendly interfaces and customizable features to tailor the maps to her specific
lesson objectives.

Scenario:
Ruth is preparing a lesson on global climate patterns and wants to use an interactive map
to illustrate the different climate zones around the world. She accesses the interactive map
tool and selects the "Climate Zones" basemap layer from the available options. Using the
zoom and pan functionalities, she focuses on a specific region to show examples of each
climate zone. Ruth then utilizes the annotation tool to highlight key features and explain the
characteristics of each climate zone to her students. Throughout the lesson, she
encourages student participation by allowing them to interact with the map, identify
different climate zones, and ask questions
